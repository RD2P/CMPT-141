QUESTION:  assuming Koffingâ€™s health stays the same, is adding more dice ALWAYS better for Pikachu? Why or why not?

ANSWER: No, more dice is not always the better for Pikachu. This is because of the unlucky number 1. The higher the number of dice, the higher the likelihood of a triplet of 1s, resulting in zero damage.
