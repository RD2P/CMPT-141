If the evolution book did not guarantee that a pokemon could not 'devolve', then the current solution could not reliably give the correct answer.
My program relies on having a source pokemon as a key in the dictionary, where it iterates over the values in the key - the immediate evolutions of that pokemon. Then it recursively calls itself, this time with the immediate evolution as the new source, so in this way it only searches 'forward'.
To address this, it would make sense to guarantee the book is correct in the first place - by writing another program to do the check. If we have to mitigate this with the can_evolve function itself, then I would probably start by taking out the first base case: if source not in book: return False, to remove the early stoppage of the program.
