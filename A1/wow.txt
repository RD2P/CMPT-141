I wrote a program that asks the user if they have read chapter 1 of the assigned readings (ITC).
The program will continually ask until the user provides the specific answers required (either "yes" or "no").
Then the user is met with a surprize quiz about things that were learned in chapter 1 of the reading. The user tries to answer all the questions while their score is tracked. 
Finally a results message is printed for the user at the end of the quiz.
