I wrote a program that asks the user about the cat and fish situation and the program draws it out.

How many cats are there? How many fish?

Based on the answers to these questions, the picture could look very different.

If there are more fish than cats (there is a fish surplus), one cat could hoard more food than it needs.

If there are more cats than fish (there is a fish scarcity)...well, let's just say it's not pretty...
